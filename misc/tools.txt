1. The command is "ipconfig", also to tell the difference (for my computer at least) it says Ethernet adapter and Wireless LAN adapter in seperate categories.

2. For this commad, you should type "ping" and then follow it with the given hostname. I know this already because I've used it to play minecraft with friends at times.

3. What I found was that for windows the command is "nslookup" followed by the given IP address. Source from https://www.techwalla.com/articles/server-ip-using-cmd-prompt

4. To copy a file from a VM to your actual computer, you first type "copy" then the location/ file you want the file to be on, then you put the original path for said file at the end. So it'd look something like this, "copy file.txt \\target_machine\destination_path\destination_file.txt".

5.For locating whether there is a process listening or not you use the "netstat" command and then scroll down to where 80 is located, at least that's how I do it.

6. I think it's also the "netstat" command? Every source I found trying to answer it only focuses on the port and not the actual host itself so this is my best guess.

7. In order to save the link of a site you use the "wget" command with an added "-r" and the full address of the website. However this won't just save the link, it will also download the whole page for offline viewing. Source from https://www.lifewire.com/uses-of-command-wget-2201085

8. For windows, you use the "Invoke-WebRequest" command followed by "-Uri" but on Mac/Linux you should use "curl" followed by "-I" Source from https://support.stackpath.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001368263-View-Response-Headers

9. I actually believe that you would use the "curl" command again, but I couldn't find what the specific additional command to go with it was.
