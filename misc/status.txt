I intend to use Kali to either finish labs and work that I don't get through in class and to also play around with it in my own free time.

However, right now it has been actually 5 hours and the software is still installing.... it should be up and running by Friday at least.

It now says" You do not have permission to enter a license key. Try again using the system administrator account.". Even though I am the Admin.
