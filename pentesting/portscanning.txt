1. Passive information gathering

- I investigated the rockstargames.com domain
- IP Address: 172.16.127.2#53
- Expiration date: 2022-11-30 at 5am
- I learned that at the very least for this gaming company there are 4 different parties involved with the domain: The Registrar, the Registrant, the Admin, and Tech (I don't know what Tech is though) Also they are all located in New York.




2. Host detection

- 172.16.127.1
  172.16.127.2
  172.16.127.128
  172.16.127.130
- All of these IP addresses represent a different server on my computer, like kali.
- First it went trhough an ARP protocol and asked "who has [IP Address]?", then afterward it answers by saying it is at 00:0c:29:05:83:2c (as an example)
- elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu (137.22.4.5)
  ada.mathcs.carleton.edu (137.22.4.19)
  olin310-23.mathcs.carleton.edu (137.22.4.21)
  137.22.4.22
- These each represent servers that the lab computer i'm using is communicating with.
- The same as before, but with alot more TCP communication. Some of which actually failed from "Host administratively prohibited".

21/ftp

- 56:56:24:0f:21:ad:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3, the host key is used for decrypting messages sent from servers when connecting to them. It's the server's public key.
- vnc, it is a platform created to allow two computer's to communicate and then take control of the other remotely.
